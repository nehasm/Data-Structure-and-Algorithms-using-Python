# Data-Structure-and-Algorithms-using-Python
This repository is dedicated for data structures and algorithms using python.
Each folder of data structure has its implemenatation in python and also the problen solving code through that data structure.
The problem solving code cover the hackerrank questions or hackerrank series of data structure. 
Here,you will get the easy solution to learn the problem solving skill using python.
